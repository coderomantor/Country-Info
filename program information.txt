Project Description:
In this project, you will create a Python program that fetches and displays information about a country based on user input. The program will use an API to get real-time data about countries, such as their population, capital, region, and more. This project is aimed at beginner-level students who are looking to practice their Python programming skills, particularly in working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building user-friendly command-line interfaces.

Project Question:
Create a Python program that asks the user to enter the name of a country and then fetches and displays the following information about the country:

Capital city
Population
Area (in square kilometers)
Region
Subregion
Official languages
The final documentation as well for this project as well.
Use anything you want many way to do this project it simple and beiginer level project.. Your program should handle errors gracefully, such as when a country is not found or if there are issues with the API request.

Project Learning Outcomes:
By completing this project, you will learn:

How to make HTTP requests in Python: Using libraries like requests to interact with web APIs.
How to parse JSON data: Extracting relevant information from JSON responses.
Basic error handling: Managing exceptions and ensuring the program can handle unexpected situations gracefully.
Working with user input: Accepting and validating input from users.
Displaying information in a user-friendly way: Formatting and presenting data neatly in the console.
